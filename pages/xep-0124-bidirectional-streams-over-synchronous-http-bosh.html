       <a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP; <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc0793">RFC 793</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1569792">1</a>]) is often used to establish a stream-oriented connection between two entities. Such connections can often be long-lived to enable an interactive "session" between the entities. However, sometimes the nature of the device or network can prevent an application from maintaining a long-lived TCP connection to a server or peer. In this case, it is desirable to use an alternative connection method that emulates the behavior of a long-lived TCP connection using a sequenced series of requests and responses that are exchanged over short-lived connections. The appropriate request-response semantics are widely available via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as specified in <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1573104">2</a>] and <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">RFC 2616</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1575424">3</a>].</p>
    <p>BOSH, the technology defined in this specification, essentially provides a "drop-in" alternative to a long-lived, bidirectional TCP connection. It is a mature, full-featured technology that has been widely implemented and deployed since 2004. To our knowledge it was the first of many similar technologies, which now include the Comet methodology formalized in the <span class="ref"><a href="http://svn.cometd.org/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html">Bayeux Protocol</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1578704">4</a>] as well as WebSocket <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC 6455</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1580576">5</a>] and <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-lentczner-rhttp">Reverse HTTP</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1582960">6</a>].</p>
    <p>BOSH is designed to transport any data efficiently and with minimal latency in both directions. For applications that require both "push" and "pull" semantics, BOSH is significantly more bandwidth-efficient and responsive than most other bidirectional HTTP-based transport protocols and the techniques now commonly known as "Ajax". BOSH achieves this efficiency and low latency by using so-called "long polling" with multiple synchronous HTTP request/response pairs. Furthermore, BOSH can address the needs of constrained clients by employing fully-compliant HTTP 1.0 without the need for "cookies" (see <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2965">RFC 2965</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1586176">7</a>])  [<a href="#nt-idp1568352">8</a>] or even access to HTTP headers.</p>
    <p>BOSH was originally developed in the Jabber/XMPP community as a replacement for an even earlier HTTP-based technology called <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0025.html">Jabber HTTP Polling (XEP-0025)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1589360">9</a>]. Although BOSH assumes that the "payload" of HTTP requests and responses will be XML, the payload formats are not limited to XMPP stanzas (see <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120">XMPP Core</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1591744">10</a>]) and could contain a mixture of elements qualified by namespaces defined by different protocols (e.g., both XMPP and JSON). BOSH connection managers are generally not required to understand anything about the XML content that they transport beyond perhaps ensuring that each XML payload is qualified by the correct namespace.</p>
    <p>Note: <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0206.html">XMPP Over BOSH (XEP-0206)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1594160">11</a>] documents some XMPP-specific extensions of this protocol that were formerly included in this document.</p>
  <h2>2.
       <a name="reqs" id="reqs">Requirements</a></h2>
    <p>The following design requirements reflect the need to offer performance as close as possible to a standard TCP connection.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Compatible with constrained runtime environments* (e.g., mobile and browser-based clients).</li>
      <li>Compatible with proxies that buffer partial HTTP responses.</li>
      <li>Efficient through proxies that limit the duration of HTTP responses.</li>
      <li>Fully compatible with HTTP/1.0.</li>
      <li>Compatible with restricted network connections (e.g., firewalls, proxies, and gateways).</li>
      <li>Fault tolerant (e.g., session recovers after an underlying TCP connection breaks at any stage during an HTTP request).</li>
      <li>Extensible.</li>
      <li>Consume significantly less bandwidth than polling-based protocols.</li>
      <li>Significantly more responsive (lower latency) than polling-based protocols.</li>
      <li>Support for polling (for clients that are limited to a single HTTP connection at a time).</li>
      <li>In-order delivery of data.</li>
      <li>Guard against unauthorized users injecting HTTP requests into a session.</li>
      <li>Protect against denial of service attacks.</li>
      <li>Multiplexing of data streams.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>*Note: Compatibility with constrained runtime environments implies the following restrictions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clients are not required to have programmatic access to the headers of each HTTP request and response (e.g., cookies or status codes).</li>
      <li>The body of each HTTP request and response is parsable XML with a single root element.</li>
      <li>Clients can specify the Content-Type of the HTTP responses they receive.</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>3.
       <a name="arch" id="arch">Architectural Assumptions</a></h2>
    <p>This document assumes that most implementations will utilize a specialized connection manager ("CM") to handle HTTP connections rather than the native connection type for the relevant application (e.g., TCP connections in XMPP). Effectively, such a connection manager is a specialized HTTP server that translates between the HTTP requests and responses defined herein and the data streams (or API) implemented by the server with which it communicates, thus enabling a client to connect to a server via HTTP on port 80 or 443 instead of an application-specific port. We can illustrate this graphically as follows:</p>
    <p class="caption"></p><div class="indent"><pre class="prettyprint">
      Server
        |
        |  [unwrapped data streams]
        |
     HTTP CM
        |
        |  [HTTP + &lt;body/&gt; wrapper]
        |
      Client
    </pre></div>
    <p>This specification covers communication only between a client and the connection manager. It does not cover communication between the connection manager and the server, since such communications are implementation-specific (e.g., the server might natively support this HTTP binding, in which case the connection manager will be a logical entity rather than a physical entity; alternatively the connection manager might be an independent translating proxy such that the server might believe it is talking directly to the client over TCP; or the connection manager and the server might use a component protocol or an API defined by the server implementation).</p>
    <p>Furthermore, no aspect of this protocol limits its use to communication between a client and a server. For example, it could be used for communication between a server and a peer server if such communication can occur for the relevant application (e.g., in XMPP). However, this document focuses exclusively on use of the transport by clients that cannot maintain arbitrary persistent TCP connections with a server. We assume that servers and components are under no such restrictions and thus would use the native connection transport for the relevant application. (However, on some unreliable networks, BOSH might enable more stable communication between servers.)</p>
  <h2>4.
       <a name="technique" id="technique">The BOSH Technique</a></h2>
    <p>The technique employed by BOSH, which is sometimes called "HTTP long polling", reduces latency and bandwidth consumption over other HTTP polling techniques. When the client sends a request, the connection manager does not immediately send a response; instead it holds the request open until it has data to actually send to the client (or an agreed-to length of inactivity has elapsed). The client then immediately sends a new request to the connection manager, continuing the long polling loop.</p>
    <p>If the connection manager does not have any data to send to the client after some agreed-to length of time [<a href="#nt-idp597424">12</a>], it sends a response with an empty &lt;body/&gt;. This serves a similar purpose to whitespace keep-alives or <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0199.html">XMPP Ping (XEP-0199)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp599248">13</a>]; it helps keep a socket connection active which prevents some intermediaries (firewalls, proxies, etc) from silently dropping it, and helps to detect breaks in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <p>Where clients and connection managers support persistent connections (i.e. "Connection: keep-alive" from HTTP/1.0, and which is the default state for HTTP/1.1), these sockets remain open for an extended length of time, awaiting the client's next request. This reduces the overhead of socket establishment, which can be very expensive if HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used.</p>
    <p>If the client has data to send while a request is still open, it establishes a second socket connection to the connection manager to send a new request. The connection manager immediately responds to the previously held request (possibly with no data) and holds open this new request. This results in the connections switching roles;  the "old" connection is responded to and left awaiting new requests, while the "new" connection is now used for the long polling loop.</p>
    <p>The following diagram illustrates this technique (possibly after XMPP session establishment)</p>

  <h2>5.
       <a name="overview" id="overview">HTTP Overview</a></h2>
    <p>The requirements of <span class="ref">RFC 2616</span> MUST be met for both requests and responses. Additional HTTP headers not specified herein MAY be included, but receivers SHOULD ignore any such headers. Clients and connection managers MAY omit headers that are not mandated by <span class="ref">RFC 2616</span> and would otherwise be ignored (e.g. if the client has constrained bandwidth), but clients are advised that network and proxy policies could block such requests.</p>
    <p>All information is encoded in the body of standard HTTP POST requests and responses. Each HTTP body contains a single &lt;body/&gt; wrapper which encapsulates the XML elements being transferred (see <a href="#wrapper">&lt;body/&gt; Wrapper Element</a>).</p>
    <p>Clients MUST send all HTTP requests as POST requests in any way permitted by <span class="ref">RFC 1945</span> or <span class="ref">RFC 2616</span>. For example, clients can be expected to open more than one persistent connection, or in some cases to open a new HTTP/1.0 connection to send each request. However, clients and connection managers SHOULD NOT use Chunked Transfer Coding, since intermediaries might buffer each partial HTTP request or response and only forward the full request or response once it is available.</p>
    <p>Clients MAY include an HTTP Accept-Encoding header in any request. If the connection manager receives a request with an Accept-Encoding header, it MAY include an HTTP Content-Encoding header in the response (indicating one of the encodings specified in the request) and compress the response body accordingly.</p>
    <p>The HTTP Content-Type header of all client requests SHOULD be "text/xml; charset=utf-8". However, clients MAY specify another value if they are constrained to do so (e.g., "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" or "text/plain"). The client and connection manager SHOULD ignore all HTTP Content-Type headers they receive.</p>
  <h2>6.
       <a name="wrapper" id="wrapper">&lt;body/&gt; Wrapper Element</a></h2>
    <p>The body of each HTTP request and response contains a single &lt;body/&gt; wrapper element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/httpbind' namespace. The content of the wrapper is the data being transferred. The &lt;body/&gt; element and its content together MUST conform to the specifications set out in <span class="ref"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML 1.0</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1639808">14</a>]. They SHOULD also conform to <span class="ref"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces in XML</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1642384">15</a>]. The content MUST NOT contain any of the following (all defined in <span class="ref">XML 1.0</span>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Partial XML elements</p></li>
      <li><p>XML comments</p></li>
      <li><p>XML processing instructions</p></li>
      <li><p>Internal or external DTD subsets</p></li>
      <li><p>Internal or external entity references (with the exception of predefined entities)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The &lt;body/&gt; wrapper MUST NOT contain any XML character data, although its child elements MAY contain character data. The &lt;body/&gt; wrapper MUST contain zero or more complete XML immediate child elements (called "payloads" in this document, e.g., XMPP stanzas as defined in <span class="ref">RFC 6120</span> or elements containing XML character data that represents objects using the JSON data interchange format as defined in <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">RFC 4627</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1649216">16</a>]). Each &lt;body/&gt; wrapper MAY contain payloads qualified under a wide variety of different namespaces.</p>
    <p>The &lt;body/&gt; element of every client request MUST possess a sequential request ID encapsulated via the 'rid' attribute; for details, refer to the <a href="#rids">Request IDs</a> section of this document.</p>
  <h2>7.
       <a name="session" id="session">Initiating a BOSH Session</a></h2>
    <div class="indent"><h3>7.1 <a name="session-request" id="session-request">Session Creation Request</a></h3>
      <p>The first request from the client to the connection manager requests a new session.</p>
      <p>The &lt;body/&gt; element of the first request SHOULD possess the following attributes (they SHOULD NOT be included in any other requests except as specified under <a href="#multi-add">Adding Streams To A Session</a>):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">'to'</span> -- This attribute specifies the target domain of the first stream.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'xml:lang'</span> -- This attribute (as defined in Section 2.12 of <span class="ref"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML 1.0</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1656496">17</a>]) specifies the default language of any human-readable XML character data sent or received during the session.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'ver'</span> -- This attribute specifies the highest version of the BOSH protocol that the client supports. The numbering scheme is "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" (where the minor number MAY be incremented higher than a single digit, so it MUST be treated as a separate integer). Note: The 'ver' attribute should not be confused with the version of any protocol being transported.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'wait'</span> -- This attribute specifies the longest time (in seconds) that the connection manager is allowed to wait before responding to any request during the session. This enables the client to limit the delay before it discovers any network failure, and to prevent its HTTP/TCP connection from expiring due to inactivity.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'hold'</span> -- This attribute specifies the maximum number of requests the connection manager is allowed to keep waiting at any one time during the session. If the client is able to reuse connections, this value SHOULD be set to "1".</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: Clients that only support <a href="#poll">Polling Sessions</a> MAY prevent the connection manager from waiting by setting 'wait' or 'hold' to "0". However, polling is NOT RECOMMENDED since the associated increase in bandwidth consumption and the decrease in responsiveness are both typically one or two orders of magnitude!</p>
      <p>A connection manager MAY be configured to enable sessions with more than one server in different domains. When requesting a session with such a "proxy" connection manager, a client SHOULD include a <span class="strong">'route'</span> attribute that specifies the protocol, hostname, and port of the server with which it wants to communicate, formatted as "proto:host:port" (e.g., "xmpp:example.com:9999").  [<a href="#nt-idp1663760">18</a>] A connection manager that is configured to work only with a single server (or only with a defined list of domains and the associated list of hostnames and ports that are serving those domains) MAY ignore the 'route' attribute. (Note that the 'to' attribute specifies the domain being served, not the hostname of the machine that is serving the domain.)</p>
      <p>The &lt;body/&gt; element of the first request MAY also possess a <span class="strong">'from'</span> attribute, which specifies the originator of the first stream and which enables the connection manager to forward the originating entity's identity to the application server (e.g., the JabberID of an entity that is connecting to an XMPP server; see <span class="ref">XEP-0206</span>).</p>
      <p>A client MAY include an <span class="strong">'ack'</span> attribute (set to "1") to indicate that it will be using acknowledgements throughout the session and that the absence of an 'ack' attribute in any request is meaningful (see <a href="#ack">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>
      <p>Some clients are constrained to only accept HTTP responses with specific Content-Types (e.g., "text/html"). The &lt;body/&gt; element of the first request MAY possess a <span class="strong">'content'</span> attribute. This specifies the value of the HTTP Content-Type header that MUST appear in all the connection manager's responses during the session. If the client request does not possess a 'content' attribute, then the HTTP Content-Type header of responses MUST be "text/xml; charset=utf-8".</p>

      <p>Note: All requests after the first one MUST include a valid 'sid' attribute (provided by the connection manager in the <a href="#session-response">Session Creation Response</a>). The initialization request is unique in that the &lt;body/&gt; element MUST NOT possess a 'sid' attribute.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="indent"><h3>7.2 <a name="session-response" id="session-response">Session Creation Response</a></h3>
      <p>After receiving a new session request, the connection manager MUST generate an opaque, unpredictable session identifier (or SID). The SID MUST be unique within the context of the connection manager application. The &lt;body/&gt; element of the connection manager's response to the client's session creation request MUST possess the following attributes (they SHOULD NOT be included in any other responses):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">'sid'</span> -- This attribute specifies the SID</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'wait'</span> -- This is the longest time (in seconds) that the connection manager will wait before responding to any request during the session. The time MUST be less than or equal to the value specified in the session request.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'requests'</span> -- This attribute enables the connection manager to limit the number of simultaneous requests the client makes (see <a href="#overactive">Overactivity</a> and <a href="#poll">Polling Sessions</a>). This value must be larger than the 'hold' attribute value specified in the session request.  The RECOMMENDED value is one more than the value of the 'hold' attribute specified in the session request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The &lt;body/&gt; element SHOULD also include the following attributes (they SHOULD NOT be included in any other responses):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="strong">'ver'</span> -- This attribute specifies the highest version of the BOSH protocol that the connection manager supports, or the version specified by the client in its request, whichever is lower.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'polling'</span> -- This attribute specifies the shortest allowable polling interval (in seconds). This enables the client to not send empty request elements more often than desired (see <a href="#poll">Polling Sessions</a> and <a href="#overactive">Overactivity</a>).</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'inactivity'</span> -- This attribute specifies the longest allowable inactivity period (in seconds). This enables the client to ensure that the periods with no requests pending are never too long (see <a href="#poll">Polling Sessions</a> and <a href="#inactive">Inactivity</a>).</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'hold'</span> -- This attribute informs the client about the maximum number of requests the connection manager will keep waiting at any one time during the session. This value MUST NOT be greater than the value specified by the client in the session request.</li>
        <li><span class="strong">'to'</span> -- This attribute communicates the identity of the backend server to which the client is attempting to connect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The connection manager MAY include an <span class="strong">'accept'</span> attribute in the session creation response element, to specify a comma-separated list of the content encodings it can decompress. After receiving a session creation response with an 'accept' attribute, clients MAY include an HTTP Content-Encoding header in subsequent requests (indicating one of the encodings specified in the 'accept' attribute) and compress the bodies of the requests accordingly.</p>
      <p>A connection manager MAY include an <span class="strong">'ack'</span> attribute (set to the value of the 'rid' attribute of the session creation request) to indicate that it will be using acknowledgements throughout the session and that the absence of an 'ack' attribute in any response is meaningful (see <a href="#ack">Acknowledgements</a>).</p>
      <p>If the connection manager supports session pausing (see <a href="#inactive">Inactivity</a>) then it SHOULD advertise that to the client by including a <span class="strong">'maxpause'</span> attribute in the session creation response element. The value of the attribute indicates the maximum length of a temporary session pause (in seconds) that a client can request.</p>
      <p>For both requests and responses, the &lt;body/&gt; element and its content SHOULD be UTF-8 encoded. If the HTTP Content-Type header of a request/response specifies a character encoding other than UTF-8, then the connection manager MAY convert between UTF-8 and the other character encoding. However, even in this case, it is OPTIONAL for the connection manager to convert between encodings. The connection manager MAY inform the client which encodings it can convert by setting the optional <span class="strong">'charsets'</span> attribute in the session creation response element to a space-separated list of encodings.  [<a href="#nt-idp1692992">19</a>]</p>
      <p>As soon as the connection manager has established a connection to the server and discovered its identity, it MAY forward the identity to the client by including a <span class="strong">'from'</span> attribute in a response, either in its session creation response, or (if it has not received the identity from the server by that time) in any subsequent response to the client.</p>

    <p>Upon receipt of a request, the connection manager SHOULD forward the content of the &lt;body/&gt; element to the server as soon as possible. In any case it MUST forward the content from different requests in the order specified by their 'rid' attributes.</p>
    <p>The connection manager MUST also return an HTTP 200 OK response with a &lt;body/&gt; element to the client. Note: This does not indicate that the payloads have been successfully delivered to the application server.</p>
    <p>It is RECOMMENDED that the connection manager not return an HTTP result until a payload has arrived from the application server for delivery to the client. However, the connection manager SHOULD NOT wait longer than the time specified by the client in the 'wait' attribute of its <a href="#session-request">Session Creation Request</a>, and it SHOULD NOT keep more HTTP requests waiting at a time than the number specified in the 'hold' attribute of the session creation request. In any case it MUST respond to requests in the order specified by their 'rid' attributes.</p>
    <p>If there are no payloads waiting or ready to be delivered within the waiting period, then the connection manager SHOULD include an empty &lt;body/&gt; element in the HTTP result:</p>

    <p>After receiving a response from the connection manager, if none of the client's requests are still being held by the connection manager (and if the session is not a <a href="#poll">Polling Session</a>), the client SHOULD make a new request as soon as possible. In any case, if no requests are being held, the client MUST make a new request before the maximum inactivity period has expired. The length of this period (in seconds) is specified by the 'inactivity' attribute in the session creation response.</p>
    <p>If the connection manager has responded to all the requests it has received within a session and the time since its last response is longer than the maximum inactivity period, then it SHOULD assume the client has been disconnected and terminate the session without informing the client. If the client subsequently makes another request, then the connection manager SHOULD respond as if the session does not exist.</p>
    <p>If the connection manager did not specify a maximum inactivity period in the session creation response, then it SHOULD allow the client to be inactive for as long as it chooses.</p>
    <p>If the session is not a polling session then the connection manager SHOULD specify a relatively short inactivity period to ensure that disconnections are discovered as quickly as possible. The RECOMMENDED time would be a little more than the number of seconds for a comfortable network round trip between the connection manager and the client under difficult network conditions (since the client can be expected to make a new request immediately -- see above).</p>
    <p>If a client encounters an exceptional temporary situation during which it will be unable to send requests to the connection manager for a period of time greater than the maximum inactivity period (e.g., while a runtime environment changes from one web page to another), and if the connection manager included a 'maxpause' attribute in its <a href="#session-response">Session Creation Response</a>, then the client MAY request a temporary increase to the maximum inactivity period by including a 'pause' attribute in a request. Note: If the connection manager did not specify a 'maxpause' attribute at the start of the session then the client MUST NOT send a 'pause' attribute during the session.</p>

    <p>If a session will use polling, the connection manager SHOULD specify a higher than normal value for the 'inactivity' attribute (see <a href="#inactive">Inactivity</a>) in its session creation response.

      <p>Unreliable network communications or client constraints can result in broken connections. The connection manager SHOULD remember the 'rid' and the associated HTTP response body of the client's most recent requests which were not session pause requests (see <a href="#inactive">Inactivity</a>) and which did not result in an HTTP or binding error. The number of responses to non-pause requests kept in the buffer SHOULD be either the same as the maximum number of simultaneous requests allowed by the connection manager or, if <a href="#ack">Acknowledgements</a> are being used, the number of responses that have not yet been acknowledged.</p>
      <p>If the network connection is broken or closed before the client receives a response to a request from the connection manager, then the client MAY resend an exact copy of the original request. Whenever the connection manager receives a request with a 'rid' that it has already received, it SHOULD return an HTTP 200 (OK) response that includes the buffered copy of the original XML response to the client (i.e., a &lt;body/&gt; wrapper possessing appropriate attributes and optionally containing one or more XML payloads).</p>
      <p>If the connection manager receives a request for a 'rid' which has already been received but to which it has not yet responded then it SHOULD respond immediately to the existing request with a recoverable binding condition (see <a href="#errorstatus-recover">Recoverable Binding Conditions</a>) and send any future response to the latest request. There is a possibility that a client might subvert polling frequency limits by deliberately sending requests for the same 'rid' multiple times, and so a connection manager implementation MAY choose to impose a limit to the frequency or number of requests for the same 'rid'. If the client exceeds this limit then the connection manager SHOULD terminate the HTTP session and return a 'policy-violation' terminal binding error to the client (see <a href="#errorstatus-terminal">Terminal Binding Conditions</a>).</p>
      <p>If the original response is not available (e.g., it is no longer in the buffer), then the connection manager MUST return an 'item-not-found' terminal binding error:</p>

    <div class="indent"><h3>15.1 <a name="keys-applic" id="keys-applic">Applicability</a></h3>
      <p>The OPTIONAL key sequencing mechanism described here MAY be used if the client's session with the connection manager is not secure. The session SHOULD be considered secure only if all client requests are made via SSL (or TLS) HTTP connections and the connection manager generates an unpredictable session ID. If the session is secure, it is not necessary to use this key sequencing mechanism.</p>
      <p>Even if the session is not secure, the unpredictable session and request IDs specified in the preceding sections of this document already provide a level of protection similar to that provided by a connection bound to a single pair of persistent TCP/IP connections, and thus provide sufficient protection against a 'blind' attacker. However, in some circumstances, the key sequencing mechanism defined below helps to protect against a more determined and knowledgeable attacker.</p>
      <p>It is important to recognize that the key sequencing mechanism defined below helps to protect only against an attacker who is able to view the contents of all requests or responses in an insecure session but who is not able to alter the contents of those requests (in this case, the mechanism prevents the attacker from injecting HTTP requests into the session, e.g., termination requests or responses). However, the key sequencing mechanism does not provide any protection when the attacker is able to alter the contents of insecure requests or responses.</p>

      <p>The OPTIONAL feature described in this section enables multiple XML streams to be contained within a single HTTP session. This feature allows for clients to connect using more than one account at the same time.

      <p>If a connection manager supports the multi-streams feature, it MUST include a 'stream' attribute in its <a href="#session-response">Session Creation Response</a>. If a client does not receive the 'stream' attribute then it MUST assume that the connection manager does not support the feature.  [<a href="#nt-idp1805664">23</a>]</p>
      <p>The 'stream' attribute identifies the first stream to be opened for the session. The value of each 'stream' attribute MUST be an opaque and unpredictable name that is unique within the context of the connection manager application.</p>

    <div class="indent"><h3>18.1 <a name="impl-pipelining" id="impl-pipelining">HTTP Pipelining</a></h3>
      <p>HTTP pipelining allows a client to send multiple requests over the same HTTP socket connection without waiting for the corresponding responses. However, <span class="ref">RFC 2616</span> notes that only idempotent methods should be allowed to use HTTP pipelining, which does not include the POST method used extensively by BOSH. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that pipelining will succeed because intermediate proxies might not support it. Therefore, clients and connection managers SHOULD NOT use HTTP Pipelining.</p>

       <a name="security" id="security">Security Considerations</a></h2>
    <div class="indent"><h3>19.1 <a name="security-client" id="security-client">Connection Between Client and BOSH Service</a></h3>
      <p>All communications between a client and a BOSH service SHOULD occur over encrypted HTTP connections. Negotiation of encryption between the client and the connection manager SHOULD occur at the transport layer or the HTTP layer, not the application layer; such negotiation SHOULD follow the HTTP/SSL protocol defined in <span class="ref"><a href="http://wp.netscape.com/eng/ssl3/draft302.txt">SSL</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1904096">28</a>], although MAY follow the HTTP/TLS protocol defined in <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">RFC 2818</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1906736">29</a>] or the TLS Within HTTP protocol defined in <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817">RFC 2817</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1909120">30</a>].</p>
      <p>If the HTTP connection used to send the initial session request is encrypted, then all the other HTTP connections used within the session MUST also be encrypted. Furthermore, if authentication certificates are exchanged when establishing the encrypted connection that is used to send the initial session request, then the client and/or connection manager SHOULD ensure that the same authentication certificates are employed for all subsequent connections used by the session. Once such a "secure session" has been established:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the connection manager refuses to establish an encrypted connection or offers a different certificate, then the client SHOULD close the connection and terminate the session without sending any more requests.</li>
        <li>If the client sends a wrapper element that is part of a "secure session" over a connection that either is not encrypted or uses a different certificate, then the connection manager SHOULD simply close the connection. The connection manager SHOULD NOT terminate the session since that would facilitate denial of service attacks.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="indent"><h3>19.2 <a name="security-app" id="security-app">Connection Between BOSH Service and Application</a></h3>
      <p>A BOSH service SHOULD encrypt its connection to the backend application using appropriate technologies such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and StartTLS if supported by the backend application. Alternatively, the BOSH service can be considered secure (1) if it is running on the same physical machine as the backend application or (2) if it running on the same private network as the backend application and the administrators are sure that unknown individuals or processes do not have access to that private network.</p>
      <p>If data privacy is desired, the client SHOULD encrypt its messages using an application-specific end-to-end encryption technology, because there is no way for the client to be sure that the BOSH service encrypts its connection to the application; methods for doing so are outside the scope of this specification.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="indent"><h3>19.3 <a name="security-sidrid" id="security-sidrid">Unpredictable SID and RID</a></h3>
      <p>The session identifier (SID) and initial request identifier (RID) are security-critical and therefore MUST be both unpredictable and nonrepeating (see <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1750">RFC 1750</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1917312">31</a>] for recommendations regarding randomness of SIDs and initial RIDs for security purposes).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="indent"><h3>19.4 <a name="security-sha" id="security-sha">Use of SHA-1</a></h3>
      <p>Recent research has shown that in select cases it is possible to compromise the hashes produced by the SHA-1 hashing algorithm (see <span class="ref"><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4270">RFC 4270</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1921248">32</a>]). However, the use to which SHA-1 is put in BOSH will likely minimize the applicability of the attacks described in the literature. Furthermore, current estimates suggest that even with the recently-discovered attack, it would still take one year of computing by a government-sized entity to produce a collision.</p>

       <a name="iana" id="iana">IANA Considerations</a></h2>
    <p>TCP port 5280, conventially used for communication between BOSH clients and BOSH connection mangers, is registered with the <span class="ref"><a href="http://www.iana.org/">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1925856">33</a>] in its port registry at <span class="ref"><a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">IANA Port Numbers Registry</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1929024">34</a>], with a keyword of "xmpp-bosh". (Although use of this port is OPTIONAL, it is helpful to define this port in a standardized way so that BOSH clients can contact any given XMPP service via BOSH without the need either for DNS TXT records as described in <span class="ref"><a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html">Discovering Alternative XMPP Connection Methods (XEP-0156)</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1931648">35</a>] or for more advanced methods such as U-NAPTR.</p>

Although the syntax of the 'route' attribute bears a superficial resemblance to a URI or IRI, it is not a URI/IRI and MUST NOT be processed in accordance with the rules specified in <span class="ref">RFC 3986</span>, <span class="ref">RFC 3987</span>, or (for XMPP) <span class="ref">RFC 5122</span>.</p><p><a name="nt-idp1692992" id="nt-idp1692992">19</a>. Each character set name (or character encoding name -- we use the terms interchangeably) SHOULD be of type NMTOKEN, where the names are separated by the white space character #x20, resulting in a tokenized attribute type of NMTOKENS (see Section 3.3.1 of <span class="ref"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML 1.0</a></span>  [<a href="#nt-idp1694512">20</a>]). Strictly speaking, the Character Sets registry maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (see &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets">http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets</a>&gt;) allows a character set name to contain any printable US-ASCII character, which might include characters not allowed by the NMTOKEN construction of XML 1.0; however, the only existing character set name which includes such a character is "NF_Z_62-010_(1973)".</p><p><a name="nt-idp1694512" id="nt-idp1694512">20</a>.
